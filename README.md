# Crop-recomadtion
Crop recommendation system that uses real-time sensor data (temperature, humidity, soil moisture) to predict optimal crops using a decision tree model. The system is deployed on an interactive web app, hosted on AWS S3, enabling easy user access and seamless crop predictions.  Tech: ML (Decision Tree), React, Python, AWS S3.
**Detailed Steps for Crop Recommendation System Project**

This section outlines the steps followed to develop and deploy the Crop Recommendation System from beginning to end.

### 1. **Project Planning and Research**
   - **Objective:** Define the goal of the project: Predict the most suitable crop based on environmental factors using machine learning.
   - **Research:** Studied relevant datasets, agricultural data, and environmental factors influencing crop growth (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc.).
   - **Technologies Chosen:** Decided to use Decision Tree for machine learning, Python for backend, React for frontend, and AWS S3 for cloud hosting.

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - **Sensor Integration:** Set up sensors to collect real-time data (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture).
   - **Dataset Collection:** Collected historical agricultural data relevant to crop growth under different environmental conditions.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Cleaning Data:** Removed inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant features from the collected datasets.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Selected features (e.g., temperature, soil moisture) and transformed them into a suitable format for model training.
   - **Splitting Data:** Split data into training and testing sets for machine learning model evaluation.

### 4. **Model Development**
   - **Choosing Algorithm:** Selected the Decision Tree algorithm due to its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data.
   - **Training the Model:** Trained the model using the cleaned dataset, ensuring it could predict the crop based on sensor readings.
   - **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's accuracy and performance using standard metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy.

### 5. **Web Application Development**
   - **Frontend Development:** Developed a user-friendly web interface using React where users can input real-time sensor data and get crop recommendations.
   - **Backend Development:** Developed the backend using Python (Flask or Django) to handle sensor data, process the model’s predictions, and serve the results to the frontend.
   - **API Integration:** Integrated the machine learning model into the backend to provide predictions through an API.

### 6. **Deployment**
   - **Web App Deployment:** Deployed the frontend (React) and backend (Python) on a cloud server for accessibility.
   - **AWS S3 Hosting:** Hosted the entire system, including the web app and data storage, on AWS S3 for secure and scalable deployment.
   - **Testing:** Conducted end-to-end testing of the entire application to ensure smooth user experience and reliable predictions.

### 7. **User Testing and Feedback**
   - **Testing:** Performed user acceptance testing with farmers and stakeholders to ensure the recommendations were accurate and the app was easy to use.
   - **Feedback Loop:** Collected user feedback to make iterative improvements on the UI and model predictions.

### 8. **Final Adjustments and Optimization**
   - **Performance Optimization:** Optimized the machine learning model and application to handle large datasets and provide faster responses.
   - **Bug Fixing:** Fixed any identified bugs or issues in the application and model to improve stability and reliability.

### 9. **Documentation**
   - **Code Documentation:** Documented the codebase to ensure ease of understanding and maintenance for future developers.
   - **User Documentation:** Created user guides for accessing the web app and understanding the system’s functionality.

### 10. **Deployment and Maintenance**
   - **Launch:** Officially launched the web application for public use.
   - **Ongoing Maintenance:** Continued monitoring the system for performance and reliability and applied necessary updates based on user feedback.

### 11. **Future Improvements**
   - **Additional Sensor Integration:** Plan to integrate additional sensors (e.g., soil pH, sunlight) to improve recommendations.
   - **Model Updates:** Continuously retrain the model with new agricultural data to keep the recommendations up to date.
